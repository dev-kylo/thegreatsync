THE GREAT SYNC — CORE CANON
───────────────────────────
This is the foundational metaphorical framework used across The Great Sync learning universe.

It defines how technical systems (especially programming concepts) are represented symbolically,
so that all analogies and teaching remain internally consistent.

───────────────────────────
I. THE WORLD
───────────────────────────
The Great Sync is a connected world of islands, ships, water, and lighthouses — a metaphorical landscape for understanding how code lives, moves, and interacts.

- **Water** represents *flow* — the movement of values, data, and control.
- **Islands** represent *values* — independent and immovable pieces of data (numbers, strings, booleans).
- **Ships** represent *objects* — movable vessels that carry cargo (state) and can change over time.
- **Water channels and rivers** represent *references* and *data flow paths* between entities.
- **Lighthouses** represent *memory and recall* — places where information can be stored, found, or forgotten.
- **The Sky** represents *potential* — ideas or functions not yet executed.
- **The Horizon** represents *boundaries* — scope and visibility rules.

This shared world anchors all analogies.

───────────────────────────
II. THE RULES OF REPRESENTATION
───────────────────────────
All agents, metaphors, and learners must follow these universal rules:

1. **No Copies Without Cause**
   Values are immutable islands. If you pick up sand from one island and carry it to another, it’s a *copy*, not a *link*.
   Only references — like bridges or telescopes — create ongoing connection.

2. **References Are Windows**
   References never create duplicates. They are telescopes or sightlines to the same object (ship). If the ship changes, every telescope sees the change.

3. **Execution Is Flow**
   Code “runs” when water moves — from a source to a destination.
   When flow stops, the system rests. When it resumes, the story continues.

4. **Functions Are Portals**
   A function is a magical door or portal that, when opened, begins a new local world (scope).
   Anything declared inside belongs to that new world unless explicitly carried back through the door.

5. **Closures Are Kept Keys**
   When a traveler (function) leaves a village (scope) but keeps a key to a storeroom there (variable binding), that storeroom stays alive.
   The closure’s key maintains connection even after the original village would have disappeared.

6. **Mutation Is Movement**
   Changing an object’s property is like rearranging cargo on a ship.
   The ship’s identity remains the same; only its contents change.

7. **Garbage Collection Is Decay**
   When no one sails to an island, visits a ship, or looks through a telescope, nature reclaims it.
   The island erodes; the ship rusts; the lighthouse light goes out. (It is collected.)

───────────────────────────
III. TEACHING STYLE AND VOICE
───────────────────────────
The Great Sync teaches through narrative and visualization, not abstraction.
Every analogy must serve understanding — not decoration.

- Use **imagination first, code second**: begin with story, then map to syntax.
- **Never mix metaphors** that contradict the world’s physics.
- **Avoid literalism**: the metaphors are guides, not physics simulators.
- **Encourage exploration**: the learner should see themselves as an explorer in this world.
- When in doubt, return to the **core forces**: water (flow), land (values), vessels (objects), light (memory).

Tone guidelines:
- Speak as a mentor or guide, not a lecturer.
- Be encouraging, visual, and concrete.
- Use second-person language (“you”).
- Avoid jargon unless it’s being defined.

───────────────────────────
IV. RED FLAGS AND FORBIDDEN ANALOGIES
───────────────────────────
These errors corrupt understanding and must be avoided in all explanations:

- ❌ “Copy of data” when describing references.
- ❌ “Variable holds a value” without explaining it as a *link* or *label*.
- ❌ Treating closures as “snapshots” instead of living connections.
- ❌ Treating memory as a “bag” of things instead of a mapped, connected landscape.
- ❌ Explaining asynchronous behavior as “simultaneous” rather than “scheduled or queued”.

Always resolve confusion by returning to water (flow), islands (values), ships (objects), and light (memory).

───────────────────────────
V. EXPANDING THE WORLD
───────────────────────────
When extending this canon to new technologies:

- Stay grounded in the world’s core physics (flow, connection, mutation, memory).
- New symbols must fit existing logic.  
  For example:
  - React component trees may become forests of trees with connected roots (state).
  - Node servers may become ports with docks handling streams of water (requests).
  - Databases may be reservoirs where water gathers, and APIs are canals between systems.

Every new addition must **harmonize** with the metaphors of The Great Sync.

───────────────────────────
Summary:
All learners, teachers, and agents share this world.
It ensures that every new analogy or lesson reinforces — never breaks — the same mental model.
