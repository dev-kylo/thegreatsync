  "truths": [
    "During creation phase, var declarations are hoisted and initialized to undefined",
    "Function declarations are hoisted with their entire definition",
    "let and const are hoisted but not initialized, creating a Temporal Dead Zone",
    "Accessing a let or const variable in the TDZ throws a ReferenceError",
    "Function expressions (assigned to variables) follow variable hoisting rules, not function declaration rules",
    "Hoisting happens within the current scope only, not globally"
  ],
  "misconceptions": [
    "WRONG: Hoisting physically moves declarations to the top of the file (it's a two-phase process)",
    "WRONG: let and const are not hoisted (they are hoisted but remain uninitialized)",
    "WRONG: Function expressions are hoisted like function declarations (they follow variable rules)",
    "WRONG: Variables can be used anywhere before declaration with var (they are undefined, which can cause bugs)"
  ],
  "tests": [
    "Can explain why console.log(x) before var x = 5 prints undefined instead of throwing an error",
    "Can explain why console.log(y) before let y = 5 throws a ReferenceError",
    "Can explain why a function declaration can be called before it appears in code",
    "Can explain why a function expression assigned to var cannot be called before declaration"
