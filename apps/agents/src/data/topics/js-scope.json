  "truths": [
    "JavaScript uses lexical scoping, where scope is determined at write-time, not run-time",
    "Variables declared with var are function-scoped, not block-scoped",
    "Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped",
    "When a variable is accessed, JavaScript searches the scope chain from inner to outer",
    "Inner scopes can access outer scope variables, but not vice versa",
    "Each function creates its own execution context with its own scope"
  ],
  "misconceptions": [
    "WRONG: All variables are block-scoped (only let/const are block-scoped)",
    "WRONG: Variables are looked up where the function is called (lexical scope is where it's defined)",
    "WRONG: Inner and outer scopes can freely access each other (only inner can access outer)",
    "WRONG: Creating a new block with {} always creates a new scope (only with let/const)"

  "tests": [
    "Can predict variable accessibility in nested function scopes",
    "Can explain the difference between var and let in a for loop",
    "Can trace how JavaScript resolves a variable through the scope chain",
    "Can explain why a variable declared in an if block with var is accessible outside the block"
