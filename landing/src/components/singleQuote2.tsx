                I am a visual learner so I love to see illustrations. 
                The fact that they are unique is even better because it is more memorable! I loved how everything was explained (in detail) and that there were example coding challenges which were then run through line by line with illustrations to understand how it all worked and to see the big picture come together.
                 I loved the use of analogies and acronyms again reinforcing the learning. Amazing skilled teaching,”
