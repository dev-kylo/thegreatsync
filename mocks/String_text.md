## String

Lots of " " and ' '. Looks like rain, doesnit it? So we're picturing it as a rainy island.

In some languages, strings aren't even primitives. But in Javascript they are. There is only ever one island per string. If you write 'Hello World' over and over again in your program, inside the JS environment you are referrring to the same island each time.
